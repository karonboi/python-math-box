# python-math-box
A stupid combination of Python scripts made by a grade 10 kid to demonstrate his walnut-sized knowledge of technology.

<b>Python Math Box</b> is a small Python library I made for some mathematic research, mainly rolling dice, tossing coins, solving equations, etc. Even though I can do it myself, it was pretty complex, so I tried to simplify it by defining functions that can be accessed multiple times and are easier to recall. Since I found the idea of having a toy box full of math stuff somewhat cool, I decided to build this little thing, both for fun, and somehow, for science.
<p>If you find it useful, then you my friend, deserve an award.
<p>It requires Python 3.10 or above and some extra libraries to work properly.
